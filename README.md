# Decentralized Funding: Blockchain Crowdfunding DApp

Welcome to **CrowdCatalyst**, a decentralized crowdfunding platform designed to reshape how projects and ideas receive funding. By leveraging the transparency, security, and immutability of blockchain technology, this DApp eliminates the need for intermediaries and creates a trustless fundraising environment where accountability is built into the process.

## 🚀 About the Project

**CrowdCatalyst** empowers project creators to raise capital directly from a global community of supporters. Our platform uses Ethereum smart contracts to automate and secure the fundraising workflow — ensuring funds are released to project creators **only when predefined milestones are achieved**. This safeguards investor interests while enabling innovative projects to thrive.

## 🎯 Key Features

* 🌍 **Decentralized & Transparent** — No intermediaries; fully on-chain transactions and records.
* 🔒 **Secure Fund Management** — Funds are locked in a smart contract and released in stages based on milestone completion.
* 📜 **Smart Contract Powered** — Automation of fundraising, milestone tracking, and disbursements.
* 🌱 **Accessible to Anyone** — Global participation via compatible Web3 wallets like MetaMask.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Blockchain Platform:** Ethereum
* **Smart Contract Language:** Solidity
* **IDE for Smart Contract Deployment:** [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
* **Web3 Provider:** MetaMask (other Web3 wallets supported)
* **Faucets:** Use testnet faucets to acquire free test ETH for contract deployment and testing.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PrazwalR/CrowdCatalyst_crowdfunding_dapp.git
   cd CrowdCatalyst_crowdfunding_dapp
   ```

2. Install a Web3 wallet (e.g., [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)).

3. Connect to a suitable Ethereum testnet (e.g., Sepolia, Goerli).

4. Acquire free test ETH from a faucet.

5. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), load the smart contract, compile, and deploy it using your connected wallet.

6. Use the generated ABI and contract address to interact with the DApp frontend or other Web3 tools.

> **Note:** You can also opt for frameworks like **Hardhat**, **Truffle**, or **Foundry** for local development and deployment, though this project currently uses Remix for simplicity and accessibility.

## 💸 Getting Test ETH

Multiple Web3 providers offer free testnet faucets. Here are some:

* [Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)
* [Alchemy Goerli Faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com/)
* [QuickNode Faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/)

Transfer the received test ETH to your wallet address connected with Remix for deploying and testing the contract.
